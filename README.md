# To Do List
This is a simple to do list, made to show the basic functionalities of React.  
Here we have an input, in which you can insert the task you have to do, and a button.  

If you click on it it will create a list of all the tasks you have to accomplish.  
It is then possible to delete the tasks once you have completed them.
